# Template-FFT

Fast Header only C++ FFT and Inverse FFT using templates.

Here is the source code for a complex FFT algorithm that uses template metaprogramming. 
It is quite fast (nearly as fast as fftw) and can be specialized to any type. We will be creating a fixed-point friendly FFT as well in the near future.

## Using the C++ template

Create the file below, and compile it with your favourite C++ compiler. Requires Eigen for handling vectors and matrices.
